# In SO question "When I execute bash, the $PATH keeps repeating itself",

#
# The reason is in
#
# SO question on Super User community "Difference between .bashrc and .bash_profile".
# Setting path incrementally in .bashrc is not correct way to set PATH.
# Any time you do source ~/.bashrc, path duplicates and same entries are
# added to PATH.
# On modern unices, there's an added complication related to ~/.profile,
# which could be solved by some effort.
#
# In Ubuntu, this is solved by enabling "Run command as login shell" option in
# Terminal setting, but this is not a permanent solution, it is platform
# specific. This change is made so that .profile is read.

#* You are using minpac to manage vim plugins.
#+ So this installs fzf in the path that minpac specifies.
#+ At present it is ~/.vim/pack/minpac/start.
#+ This changes the path that you should use when following
#+ the steps to install fzf in book "Modern Vimcraft". In our case
#+ path in the command on page 24 of "modern vimcraft" should be
#+ `~/.vim/pack/minpac/start/fzf/install --bin`.
#* Also that you are cloning fzf when you do a
#+ `:call minpac#update()` in vim.
#+ This clones the fzf repository but does not install it.
#+ To install you can do 
#+ `~/.vim/pack/minpac/start/fzf/install --bin`.
#+ In our case when we hit ctrl-p from vim, we
#+ are prompted to install the binary.
