---> comment out a mapping, then source vimrc. The mapping still exist. Fix this.

---> Vim fugitive highlight for messages. (messages that come on pressing mapping
shortcuts like <leader>gis)

---> Bring color, unicode, etc to the output echoed below vim's command line?
A. Last time your search stopped at this answer: [Refer : https://stackoverflow.com/a/22977440/11320006]

  NOTE: [Refer: http://vimcasts.org/episodes/fugitive-vim---a-complement-to-command-line-git/]
  If a command generates a lot of output then run it from the terminal.
  Take `Git log` for example, git automatically pipes the output into a pager making
  it easy to read whereas if you run `Git log` through fugitive, vim echoes the output
  as a stream which is not so easy to work with.
  On the other hand commands that don't generate a lot of output are fair game for
  running with fugitives git command. Like `Git status` or `Git checkout`
