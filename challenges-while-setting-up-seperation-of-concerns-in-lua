First and foremost - What you are trying to do? 
Answer: You are separating the large vimrc file to separated files. You have already done it with vimscript,
but since neovim uses lua, you are trying separation of concern using lua language. For this
you are following Praveen Dhawan's dotfile repo.

Hurdles encountered :-

1. modules listed in config_file.lua were not found .

  --> [https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide#module]
  Lua modules are found inside a lua/ folder in your 'runtimepath' (for most users, this will mean ~/.config/nvim/lua on *nix systems and ~/AppData/Local/nvim/lua on Windows). You can require() files in this folder as Lua modules.

  To overcome errors similar to "no field package.preload['lua.plugins']", what you had to do was
  copy files required files from dotfiles/* to ~/.config/nvim

2. In lua/plugins/keybindings/lsp/init.lua require('lspconfig') throwing similar error as above.

  [Tip 2 in Modern Vim Craft]
  Answer: nvim-lspconfig is installed in ~/.vim/pack/*. To run the pacakges installed in this
  path we have to include in runtimepath ~/.vim/*

  see `:h packpath`

3. Packages in ~/.vim/pack/ path not loading

  Answer: `source ~/.vim/vimrc` in ~/.config/nvim/init.vim

4. Since, at this point in time some the plugings are not configured (Just, the lsp,
  and that too is not working. But the file lua/plugins/keybindings/lsp/init.lua is getting 
  executed without any errors, Good job!) many plugins like nvim-cmp are not working.
  For this moving the code for the plugings to their respective files.

  4.1) Why was lsp not working?
  Answer) The function `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_option(bufnr, ...)` in the file 
  lua/plugins/keybindings/lsp/init.lua was receiving more arguments than expected.
