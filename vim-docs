1. Why fzf anf fzf.vim plugins are not a part of package manager (minpac, in our case)?
A. Removing fzf as part of minpac because we also need to 
  source fzf completion script from bash_profile,
  which can come only after fzf is cloned. (not necessarily, but installed
  too)

2. Regex based syntax highlighting v/s Parser based syntax highlighting?
A. Set syntax off (a regexp based syntax highlighter and let

3. How to map CAPS LOCK key in VIM?
A. (REFER: Stackoverflow bookmarked: How to map CAPS LOCK key in VIM?)
`
au VimEnter * !xmodmap -e 'clear Lock' -e 'keycode 0x42 = Control'
au VimLeave * !xmodmap -e 'clear Lock' -e 'keycode 0x42 = Caps_Lock'
`

The first line maps escape to the caps lock key when you enter Vim, and the
second line returns normal functionality to caps lock when you quit.
This requires Linux with the xorg-xmodmap package installed.

6. Projectionist mapping for directory structure.
A. [Refer: See Greg Hurrell vim screencast video on youtube]

  Dir structure:
   |--Component
     |--component.js
     |--component.spec.js
     |--component.scss

   In vimrc:
     `
     let g:projectionist_heuristics = {
       \"*": {
	 \"*.js": {
	   \"alternate": [
	     \"{}.spec.js",
	   \"{}.scss"
	     \],
	     \"type": "source"
	       \},
	 \"*.spec.js": {
	   \  "alternate": [
	     \"{}.scss",
	   \"{}.js"
	     \],
	     \  "type": "test"
	       \  },
	 \"*.scss": {
	   \  "alternate": [
	     \"{}.js",
	   \"{}.test.js"
	     \],
	     \  "type": "style"
	       \}

8. How to implement extend selection/expand selection scope?
A. [Refer: https://superuser.com/a/586081/1707829]
  To select a curly-braced block do: v+a+{, to select the enclosing block repeat a+{. 
  Note that you can choose to only select the contents of the braces by using i instead of a

  These commands, as many others in vim, are built up by an action followed by a text-object,
  where the text-object can be prepended by a number to include more objects affected 
  by the action. So you could also delete the object by replacing v by d or correct 
  it with c, etc.

9. How to put current line at top/center/bottom of screen in vim?
A. [Refer: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/110252/395825]
  `zEnter` or zt puts current line to top of screen

  `z.` or `zz` puts current line to center of screen
  
  `z-` or `zb` puts current line to bottom of screen
  
  (`zEnter`, `z.,` and `z-` puts the cursor in the first non blank column. `zt`, `zz`, and `zb` leaves the cursor in the current column)

12. How do I copy a file in netrw?
A. [Refer: https://vi.stackexchange.com/a/6264/26997]

  MARKED FILES: COPYING                                           netrw-mc {{{2
	      (See netrw-mf and netrw-mr for how to mark files)
			(Uses the global marked file list)

  Select a target directory with mt (netrw-mt).  Then change directory,
  select file(s) (see netrw-mf), and press "mc".  The copy is done
  from the current window (where one does the mf) to the target.

  If one does not have a target directory set with netrw-mt, then netrw
  will query you for a directory to copy to.

  One may also copy directories and their contents (local only) to a target
  directory.
