# This was the content of .profle before I reverted back to OS installtion time
# contents. This happend when I was configuring PATH to include /home/bin,
# which surprisingly in Ubuntu is already there.

# Making changes to Terminal settings and changing code (that
# was setup by OS, during its installation) of original .profile file.
# In Ubuntu, the setting change is: enabling "Run command as login shell"
# option in Terminal setting, but this is not a permanent solution, 
# it is platform specific. This change is made so that .profile is read.
#
# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.
# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
# exists.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.
# the files are located in the bash-doc package.

# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
#umask 022
