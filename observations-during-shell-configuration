(REFER SO Ask Ubuntu Q 'What is the meaning of -bash?')

Meaning of output of command:

`echo $0`	---- 1

the output of this command can be either 'bash' or '-bash'

Before deciphering the meaning of this, let's see what the bash manual,
section on INVOCATION says:
"A login shell is one whose first character of argument zero is a -, or one started with the --login option."

Now recall that there is an option in Ubuntu Terminal Settings(or, Preferences),
"Run command as login shell"

If you enable this option and run command 1, the o/p is '-bash', otherwise
the o/p is 'bash'
These outputs can be taken as indication the determine whether the shell is
login or non login. But,
according to Greg wiki bash guide, Parameters page,
`$0` "Contains the name, or the path, of the script. This is not always reliable."

Nevertheless, we have a way to test this. According to bash manual, section on INVOCATION:
"$- includes i if bash is interactive, allowing a shell script or a startup file to test this state."


READ INVOCATION section in bash manual, to find out more about files in /etc/*, and files like
.bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile.

and
 
READ comments in these files.
TODO Later move these comments from those files to this file.


In Ubuntu, right after OS installation the contents of
~/.profile file and /etc/skel/.profile file are ditto, and
so are the contents of
~/.bashrc file and /etc/skel/.bashrc .
skel stands for skeleton
