!One of the more irritating differences between keyboards is the location of the
!Control and CapsLock keys.  A common use of xmodmap is to swap these two keys as follows:
!
! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L
!
!
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L
keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L

!This example can be run again to swap the keys back to their previous assignments.
!A consequence of this is that, when the command `xmodmaprc ~/.xmodmaprc` is put in 
!the file .bash_profile, and  when a terminal window is first opened
!the mapping is applied as a result of read from that file.
!On closing and reopening(or opening another terminal when one already is open)
!the terminal again, the mapping is reset(or toggled).
